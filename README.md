**Hunt the Ace** is a fun and interactive browser-based card game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges the player to keep track of the Ace card after a quick shuffle, and rewards them if they can guess its location correctly.

## ✨ Extended Description

> This project is a browser game that simulates a classic shell game using playing cards — specifically the Ace. The player is shown the Ace along with two decoy cards, which are then shuffled. The user must watch closely and click the card where they think the Ace is hiding.  
>
> It's designed to test memory, focus, and reaction speed in a fast-paced mini-game format. Ideal for showcasing frontend logic, DOM manipulation, animations, and event handling using vanilla JavaScript.
